     <h1> <strong>Re: Eileen Dover university application </strong> </h1>

     <p> Dear Eileen,
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part <br> 
        of your <u>PhD</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections. </p>

        <h2> <strong> Starting Dates </strong></h2>
        <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br> 
            could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>First semester: 9 September 2016 </li>
                <li> Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                <li> Third semester 2 May 2017 </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer. </p>
            <p>You can find more information about <u>important university dates on our website.</u></p>

            <h2><strong>Subjects of study</strong></h2>

            <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>
                somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
                 the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
                  by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

                  <ol>
                      <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
                      <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when <br>
                         the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li>
                      <li> <strong> <u>HTML</u></strong> and <strong><u>CSS</u></strong> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>   

                      </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br> 
                    research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

                    <h2><strong> Erotic dance moves</strong></h2>
                    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I  <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
                         my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
                         <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
                         <blockquote> <p>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around <br>
                            in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.</p></blockquote>
                            
                            <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
                            <blockquote><p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br> 
                                involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably <br> 
                                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
                                 modem styles such as Twerking.</p></blockquote>

                                 <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
                                 <blockquote><p>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
                                    discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
                                    of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
                                    because they were really cold.</p></blockquote>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>For more of my research, see my <u>exotic dance research page.</u></p>
                                    <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
